## We are excited to announce that Blazor REPL is now part of Progress and has a new home under [Progress Telerik REPL for Blazor](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/)!  

We believe that code writing and sharing should be an easy-breezy experience and available to everyone - from programming novices to expert levels.  Our love for Blazor, our understanding of developer needs, and our goal to help developers from all walks of life be more productive have led us to the decision to engage in a transaction with Progress that would allow to bring the already popular Blazor REPL tool to the next level.  

All existing snippets created with https://blazorrepl.com will continue to work as is and the functionality remains open and free to the Blazor community at its new home https://blazorrepl.telerik.com. You will not only be able to continue using the features you are familiar with such as: write, run, share code snippets, referencing static assets and installing NuGet packages, but we are also excited to share that you can now enjoy new functionalities and brand new design and UX - make sure to check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/repl/getting-started). 

While the transaction pertains that the source code will no longer be available at the current repo, we acknowledge that any code obtained from this repository prior to this announcement can continue to be used under the GPL v2 license. 

With the initial release of Telerik REPL for Blazor several enhanced functionalities have been added and now you can take advantage of:  

- Sharing your Blazor code snippets in Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and via email 
- Sharing your snippets directly from your favorite IDE: Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code 
- Embedding the code editor within your blog posts and websites 
- Integration with Telerik UI for Blazor components and themes
